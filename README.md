Got it — here’s a **README** that’s short, powerful, and shows off Clojure’s syntax with minimal but impactful examples:

# Clojure Tutorial

Clojure is a modern Lisp: **simple syntax**, **immutable data**, and **powerful abstractions**. This repo shows its essentials through small, sharp examples.

## 🔑 Core Syntax

```clojure
;; Lists and function calls
(+ 1 2 3)        ;; => 6
(str "Hello" " " "World") ;; => "Hello World"

;; Bindings
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))       ;; => 30

;; Functions
(defn square [n] (* n n))
(square 5)       ;; => 25
```

## 📦 Data Structures

```clojure
;; Immutable vectors, lists, maps, sets
[1 2 3]              ;; vector
'(a b c)             ;; list
{:a 1 :b 2}          ;; map
#{1 2 3}             ;; set

;; Destructuring
(let [{:keys [a b]} {:a 1 :b 2}]
  (+ a b))           ;; => 3
```

## ⚡ Functional Power

```clojure
(map inc [1 2 3])          ;; => (2 3 4)
(filter even? (range 10))  ;; => (0 2 4 6 8)
(reduce + [1 2 3 4])       ;; => 10
```

## 🔄 Concurrency

```clojure
(def counter (atom 0))
(swap! counter inc)   ;; => 1
```

## 🌀 Macros

```clojure
(defmacro unless [pred body]
  `(if (not ~pred) ~body))

(unless false (println "Runs!"))
```

✨ With just a few primitives, Clojure unlocks **expressive, concurrent, and extensible** programming.

Do you want me to expand this with a **“common one-liners” cheatsheet** (like threading macros, anonymous functions, etc.) to make it even punchier?
